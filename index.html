          <h3>Web Design and Development</h3>
          <p>If your website doesn't sell products, book appointments, and is mainly just used to showcase a menu, hours, popular products or services, etc... then you only need what I consider to be a basic website. I build these for a flat rate of $100 and will re-work your site until you're 100% satisfied with the end product or there's no charge. If you would like an online shop built, or anything more complicated with appointment booking or checkouts to collect payments or anything of the sort then I do offer an Advanced site package - this is $200 and I build you site for you, add your products, images, and incorporate a working check-out for online sales. I'm also certified through "programming hub" for completing courses in: penetration testing, network security, html, css, SEO, php, blockchain technology, among others. This ensures that all code I write is clear enough that another developer in the future won't have a hard time understanding it - giving you the option of letting anyone in the future help you maintain your site instead of forcing you to return to me. It also lets you know that I develop with site security in mind and penetration test the site personally to make sure there's no security threats in the delivered project. </p>

          <h3>Site Upgrades</h3>
          <p>For businesses today, itâ€™s not just about having a website. It's about having an effective, multifunctional portal that plays a crucial marketing role. Whether your business is B2B, B2C or both, your website should spearhead your Demand Acceleration by inviting, informing and engaging your target audience. I can rework and upgrade any existing site into something stunnning that captures the attention of your visitors. With a SEO certificate of completion from programming hub I also include Search Engine Optimization with all site upgrades to help your site rank better on google and other search engines. I know the tactics in and out to make your site look better to google and the robots it uses to rank page listing and can help land yours higher than it currently is. This also includes penetration testing on the final product to find and fix any existing security issues. EVERY SINGLE CHANGE I make will be ran by the customer to ensure that nothing is being changes that they don't want to be changed. This service is paid upon completion, if you're not happy with the work I've done - you don't pay. Plain and simple. </p>

          <h3>Fully Managed Packages</h3>
          <p> With the fully managed packages not only do you get development, search engine optimization, security testing, and your content added but I also set up the hosting servers and accounts and maintain your site personally. This package starts at $50 a month and gives you 24/7 support for any issues related to your site. You can request upgrades, updates, or changes at any time and I'll start working on them within 24 hours to get them on your live site as soon as possible. It's all the perks of having your own developer on your payroll without actually having to hire your own developer.		  </p>
