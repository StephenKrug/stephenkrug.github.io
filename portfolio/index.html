          <p>This site was built with a fancy Italian restaurant in mind. It's visually pleasing and reflects a sophisticated website for a  place with sophisticated food. This site features the option to plug in your location using google maps to make it easy for new visitors to find directions. It also displays your best selling items on the menu with some photo's, as well as a form to book a reservation. This could easily be plugged into a free service like google calendar to prevent over booking issues if that's a concern.  </p>

          <h3>Fully Managed Packages</h3>
          <p> With the fully managed packages not only do you get development, search engine optimization, security testing, and your content added but I also set up the hosting servers and accounts and maintain your site personally. This package starts at $50 a month and gives you 24/7 support for any issues related to your site. You can request upgrades, updates, or changes at any time and I'll start working on them within 24 hours to get them on your live site as soon as possible. It's all the perks of having your own developer on your payroll without actually having to hire your own developer.		  </p>
